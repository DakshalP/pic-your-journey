### (Instructions)
After cloning, create a `app-env.ts` file in the `src/` directory. It needs to contain two free public api keys from unsplash.com and geocode.io in order to work.

```
//inside src/app-env.ts
export var unsplashKey: string = 'YOUR_KEY'
export var gecodeKey: string = 'YOUR_KEY'
```
